## Initial Design Inspiration

**AI**: Let's create a design system that ensures your app looks great on all devices. First, help me understand your vision.

**What's your design inspiration?**
- [ ] An existing app (WhatsApp, Instagram, Notion, etc.)
- [x] A brand/company style
- [ ] A design mood (minimal, playful, professional)
- [ ] I have specific colors/fonts in mind
- [ ] I'm open to suggestions

**User**: Actually, both! I like WhatsApp's clean look but with Discord's organization. And I want it to feel warm and friendly, not corporate.

**AI**: Perfect combination! WhatsApp's clarity with Discord's structure. Let me dig deeper.

**Which aspects of WhatsApp do you like most?**
- Clean message bubbles
- Minimal interface
- Mobile-first design
- Fast performance feel

**User**: All of those! Especially the message bubbles and how it feels fast even on slow phones.

**AI**: And from Discord, what organizational features appeal to you?

**User**: The server/channel list on the left, but simpler. Just rooms, no voice channels or categories within categories.

## Visual Personality Definition

**AI**: Now let's define the personality of your design. Rate these scales:

```
Formal ‚Üê‚Üí Casual
[1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]

Serious ‚Üê‚Üí Playful  
[1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]

Minimal ‚Üê‚Üí Expressive
[1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]

Tech-focused ‚Üê‚Üí Human-focused
[1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]
```

**User**: 
- Formal ‚Üí Casual: **[2]** - Professional but approachable
- Serious ‚Üí Playful: **[2]** - Friendly, not silly
- Minimal ‚Üí Expressive: **[3]** - Clean but with personality
- Tech ‚Üí Human: **[2]** - People-first

**AI**: Great! You want a warm, approachable design that's clean but not sterile. What's most important?

**User**: Clarity and simplicity, but it should make people want to use it. Not boring.

## Color System Development

**AI**: You mentioned warm and friendly. Discord uses a cool purple (#5865F2). Should we start there and warm it up?

**User**: Yes! Purple but warmer. Like sunset purple, not cold space purple.

**AI**: I'll create a warmer purple palette. Here's what I'm thinking:

```css
/* Cool Discord Purple ‚Üí Warm ChatFlow Purple */
Discord: #5865F2 ‚Üí ChatFlow: #9333EA

/* Adding warmth with complementary colors */
Primary: #9333EA (Warm purple)
Accent: #F59E0B (Coral/Amber for warmth)
```

**User**: Love it! Can we have the coral as accent for important buttons?

**AI**: Absolutely! Here's your full color palette:

```css
:root {
  /* Primary - Warm Purple */
  --primary: #9333EA;
  --primary-hover: #7C3AED;
  --primary-light: #F3E8FF;
  
  /* Accent - Coral */
  --accent: #F59E0B;
  --accent-hover: #D97706;
  
  /* Semantic Colors */
  --success: #10B981;  /* Emerald */
  --warning: #F59E0B;  /* Amber */
  --error: #EF4444;    /* Rose */
  --info: #3B82F6;     /* Blue */
}
```

**User**: Perfect! Can we have a dark mode too?

**AI**: Of course! For dark mode, should we go with:
1. Dark gray backgrounds (like Discord)
2. True black (OLED-friendly)
3. Navy/purple tinted dark

**User**: True black! My phone has OLED.

## Typography Selection

**AI**: For fonts, what's your preference?

**Font preference:**
- [x] System fonts (fastest, most familiar)
- [ ] Google Fonts (free, lots of choice)
- [ ] Premium fonts (I'll provide)
- [ ] Let me suggest based on your style

**User**: Can we use system fonts but maybe Inter for headers? I've seen it everywhere and it looks good.

**AI**: Perfect choice! Inter is modern, highly readable, and free. Here's your typography system:

```css
:root {
  /* Font Stack */
  --font-sans: 'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  --font-mono: 'Fira Code', monospace;
  
  /* Mobile-First Sizes (no iOS zoom!) */
  --text-base: 1rem;     /* 16px */
  --text-lg: 1.125rem;   /* 18px */
  --text-xl: 1.25rem;    /* 20px */
  
  /* Desktop bumps up */
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    --text-base: 1.125rem; /* 18px */
  }
}
```

**User**: Why 16px base on mobile?

**AI**: Great question! iOS Safari zooms in on any input with font-size less than 16px. This prevents that annoying zoom when users tap input fields.

---

## Spacing System

**AI**: How spacious should your design be?

**User**: Not cramped, but not too spread out. WhatsApp-like but with a bit more breathing room.

**AI**: I'll create a balanced spacing system based on 4px grid:

```css
:root {
  /* Base: 4px grid */
  --space-1: 0.25rem;   /* 4px */
  --space-2: 0.5rem;    /* 8px */
  --space-3: 0.75rem;   /* 12px */
  --space-4: 1rem;      /* 16px */
  --space-6: 1.5rem;    /* 24px */
  --space-8: 2rem;      /* 32px */
  
  /* Touch targets */
  --touch-target: 44px;  /* Apple's recommendation */
}
```

---

## Component Styling

**AI**: Let's define how interactive elements behave. What interaction style do you prefer?

**User**: Responsive feedback but not too playful. Like a subtle bounce or lift, not spinning or sliding everywhere.

**AI**: Here's what I'll implement:

```css
/* Buttons lift slightly on hover */
.btn:hover {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-primary);
}

/* Smooth transitions */
--transition-all: all 200ms ease;

/* Friendly rounded corners */
--radius-lg: 0.5rem;    /* Buttons */
--radius-xl: 0.75rem;   /* Cards */
--radius-2xl: 1rem;     /* Modals */
--radius-3xl: 1.5rem;   /* Message bubbles */
```

**User**: Yes! And for messages, make them really rounded like WhatsApp?

**AI**: Absolutely! Super rounded for that friendly feel:

```css
.message-bubble {
  border-radius: var(--radius-2xl); /* 16px */
  /* But square off the corner pointing to sender */
}
```

## Mobile-Specific Patterns

**AI**: Since most users will be on phones, how should mobile navigation work?

**User**: Bottom tabs for main navigation? And the member list slides in from the right?

**AI**: Great choices! Here's the mobile pattern:

```css
/* Bottom navigation */
.mobile-nav {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
}

/* Slide-in member list */
.member-list {
  transform: translateX(100%);
  transition: transform 300ms ease-out;
}

.member-list.open {
  transform: translateX(0);
}
```

## Mockup Tool Integration

**AI**: Now let's set up your design system in the FlexOS mockup tool for rapid prototyping.

**Setting up mockup tool:**
```bash
# Navigate to mockup directory
cd /mockups

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Sync your new design tokens
npm run sync:from-vue
```

**Your design tokens are now available in mockups!**
You can start prototyping immediately at `http://localhost:3000`

**Quick mockup workflow:**
1. Design in browser with hot reload
2. Test all breakpoints instantly
3. Preview dark/light modes
4. Export component usage
5. Convert to Vue when ready

## Post-Generation Notes

**User**: This is perfect! One more thing - can the animations be disabled for people who don't like motion?

**AI**: Already included! Check the bottom of `globals.css`:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

**User**: And I can test this in the mockup tool too?

**AI**: Absolutely! The mockup tool respects all system preferences:
- Dark mode: Toggle with üåì button
- Reduced motion: System setting applies
- High contrast: Automatic when enabled

You can even force states for testing:
```javascript
// In mockup page
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-motion', 'reduced');
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-contrast', 'high');
```

**User**: You thought of everything! This wizard is amazing.

**AI**: That's the power of specification-driven development! Every decision is captured and documented, ready for the AI builder to implement perfectly. üé®‚ú®
