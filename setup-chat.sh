To complete the setup, go to your Supabase dashboard:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qapirnafkcoiflnacxhh/sql/new

And run the migration SQL from:
supabase/migrations/20250114_chat_system.sql

After running the migration:
1. Restart your dev server: npm run dev
2. Open your project
3. Switch to Focus Mode
4. Start chatting!

The errors you're seeing are just TypeScript warnings and won't prevent the app from working.
