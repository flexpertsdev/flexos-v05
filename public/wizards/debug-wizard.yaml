      🔍 **Debug Analysis Complete**
      
      **Issue Type:** {{answers.issue-type}}
      **Location:** {{answers.issue-location}}
      **Browsers Affected:** {{answers.browser-info}}
      
      **Common Issues Detected:**
      {{#each answers.common-issues}}
      • {{this}}
      {{/each}}
      
      **My Diagnosis:**
      Based on your description, this appears to be a layout calculation issue, likely caused by:
      
      1. **Viewport units on mobile** - Using 100vh doesn't account for browser UI
      2. **Fixed positioning conflicts** - Multiple fixed elements competing for space
      3. **Missing overflow handling** - Content has nowhere to go when constrained
      
      **I'll provide:**
      1. Immediate fix to stop the issue
      2. Proper refactor for long-term stability
      3. Best practices to prevent recurrence
      4. Test cases to verify the fix
